Gesture Recognition
We want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognize five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote. 
The five gestures are as follows:
•	Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
•	Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
•	Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
•	Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
•	Stop: Pause the movie
